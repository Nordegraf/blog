### About me
Currently undergrad in computer science and bioinformatics at Goethe University Frankfurt.

I have a strong interest in computational science, high performance computing and solving methods for differential equations. During my undergrad studies I began specialisation in these subjects and intend to expand on my knowledge during my graduate studies.

### Education
I finished my bachelor thesis in CS at the Goethe Center for Scientific Computing on the subject of modelling salt water intrusion in unsaturated porous media under supervision of Dr. Arne NÃ¤gel.
Additionally I'm currently finishing my bachelor thesis in bioinformatics on transport and production of nitrite in the unsaturated zone of porous media.

### Experience
I have experience in several programming languages most notably **Python** and **C++**. Moreover I have some experience in **Lua**, **Haskell**, **Octave/MatLab** and **Java**.

For personal projects I aquired knowledge in multiple database systems like **MariaDB**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite** and **MongoDB**, microcontrollers including **Raspberry Pi**, **ESP8266**, **ESP32** and **Arduino**, DevOps like **Docker**, **Docker Compose** or simple tasks in the CI/CD Pipelines of GitLab and GitHub and simple Frontend Development using **HTML**, **SCSS** and **JavaScript**.
